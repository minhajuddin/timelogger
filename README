Timelogger
==========

## Logger

  1. You can log a task simply by running `timelogger task description .....`


## Watcher
  1. Allows you to hook up a cron task which sends an email with all the
     analysis

## Analyzer

 Analyzes your timelogs and emails you the statistics at the end of
 every week/work. For this to work, we make a few assumptions:

  1. The first word /[a-zA-Z-_]/ is treated as the project name, e.g. `gl gocms`
     implies that gocms is the name of your project

  2. The second word /[a-zA-Z-_]/ is treated as the task in that project.
     e.g. `gl learn code-reading` implies a subproject of code-reading

  3. A task with two stars '**' or two colons '::' is considered to be a non
     work task. These tasks too can have a project and subproject.
     e.g. `gl break lunch`

  4. A task with '+' parses the projects between '+'
     e.g. `gl break + sleep` assigns the time to both the projects?
     Try to avoid these

  5. You are assumed to log *after* the task is finished, i.e. once you have
     spent time working on something. e.g. At the end of working on a coding
     session on timelogger you would run `gl timelogger dev`
